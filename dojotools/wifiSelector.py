"""
This module provides functionalities related to wireless network interface 
management on Debian/Ubuntu versions of Linux. It includes capabilities for 
identifying wireless interfaces and allowing the user to select one of 
these interfaces interactively.

It uses various utilities from the 'devtools' package to support its 
operations. This includes detecting the operating system, looking up the 
OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) of MAC addresses, and drawing 
lines for aesthetic terminal output.

Functions:
    get_wlan_interfaces():
        Scans and retrieves available WLAN interfaces and their 
        respective MAC addresses.

    interface_selector(wlan_interfaces, showmac=True, linetype=1):
        Provides an interactive interface for selecting a WLAN 
        interface from the list of available interfaces.

Note:
    - The module is specifically designed for use on Debian/Ubuntu 
    Linux distributions.
    - It heavily relies on the structure of the '/sys/class/net' 
    directory for gathering network interface information.

    Scans the system to identify available wireless network interfaces

    This function checks for WLAN interfaces by inspecting the

    Returns:

    Provides an interactive interface for selecting a wireless network 
    interface from a given list.

    This function displays a list of available WLAN interfaces. If 
    'showmac' is True, it also shows the MAC address and the corresponding 
    OUI vendor name for each interface. The user can select an interface by 
    entering its corresponding number.

    Parameters:
    wlan_interfaces (dict): A dictionary of WLAN interfaces and their
      MAC addresses.
    showmac (bool, optional): Whether to show MAC addresses and OUI 
    vendor names. Defaults to True.
    linetype (int, optional): The type of line to be drawn for aesthetic 
    separation. Defaults to 1 (solid line).

    Returns:
    str | None: The selected interface name, or None if the user quits 
    or fails to select a valid interface within the allowed attempts.

    Note:
    - The user has a limited number of attempts (default 3) to make a 
    valid selection.
    - The function allows refreshing the list of interfaces or quitting 
    the selection process.
    - This function relies on 'devtools.drawLine' for drawing lines 
    and 'devtools.ouiLookup' for OUI lookups.

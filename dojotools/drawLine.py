"""
This module provides a function to draw decorative lines in the terminal.

The function 'draw_line' prints a line composed of a specific character, 
spanning the entire width of the terminal window. It leverages the 
os.get_terminal_size method to dynamically determine the width of the 
terminal at runtime, ensuring that the printed line always fits perfectly 
across the terminal window, regardless of its current size.

Functions:
    draw_line(linetype=1): Prints a line of a specified type across the terminal window.

Available Line Types:
    1: Solid line (─)
    2: Dotted line (∙)
    3: Diamond line (⌶)
    4: Star line (☆)
    5: Double line (⏥)
    Any other value defaults to a solid line (─).

The function is primarily intended for use in console-based applications 
where visually distinct sections are required for better readability or 
aesthetic appeal.

Example:
    >>> draw_line(3)
    This will print a line of diamonds spanning the width of the terminal.

Returns:
    True: Indicates successful execution and line printing.
